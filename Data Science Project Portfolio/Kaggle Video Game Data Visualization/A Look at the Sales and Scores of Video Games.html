This will give us a good idea of which platforms are more popular:</p><figure name="748c" id="748c" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*aIBo_C2dJ-ov919FzrCSqg.png" data-width="1829" data-height="1174" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*aIBo_C2dJ-ov919FzrCSqg.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Graphic created in Tableau</figcaption></figure><p name="91a5" id="91a5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The PS2 and DS are close 1st and 2nd in terms of titles released. The PS2 (released by Sony in 2000) enjoyed a consistently high title release count from 2001 to about 2006, coinciding with the release of the PS3. Meanwhile, the DS (released by Nintendo in 2004) was massively popular in 2006 up to 2011, coinciding with the release of the 3DS.</p><p name="48f8" id="48f8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Finally, we will have a look at yearly title sales by units sold globally, and by region. This will give us a picture of the relative size of each video game market, and how the market has changed over time:</p><figure name="a421" id="a421" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*4dA_RdI_Xf1Ni8gfC-u8Ow.png" data-width="1576" data-height="1078" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*4dA_RdI_Xf1Ni8gfC-u8Ow.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Graphic created in Tableau</figcaption></figure><p name="3748" id="3748" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The global video game market surged from 1995, likely owing to the massive popularity of Sony’s PlayStation. From 2008 however, we see massive dips in sales across the globe, likely due to a combination of the late 2000s financial recession and a shift of the gaming market towards casual mobile gaming.</p><h3 name="8265" id="8265" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Answering Question 1</h3><p name="ac6c" id="ac6c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">How has each platform performed in terms of titles released and global sales?</p><figure name="d969" id="d969" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*lp7v5CB9LOZM08lXTbpgsg.jpeg" data-width="889" data-height="500" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*lp7v5CB9LOZM08lXTbpgsg.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption"><a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-life-cycle-xbox-ps5/" data-href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-life-cycle-xbox-ps5/" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Retrieved from: wccftech.com</a></figcaption></figure><p name="6233" id="6233" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Video game consoles and platforms tend to follow “generations” of release, which coincide with the releases of new, next-generation consoles. For instance: The first generation of video games saw the introduction of Pong and many copy-cats. Consoles released in concurrent generations tend to compete most heavily with each other.</p><p name="ffd0" id="ffd0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Nintendo would introduce their first console in the first generation, a dedicated system called the Color TV-Game, and would subsequently introduce new systems each generation from the 3rd generation onwards with the NES, SNES, N64, GCN, Wii and Wii U.</p><p name="3bb3" id="3bb3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Early on, Nintendo would face competition from SEGA, lasting from the 3rd generation up to the 6th, where SEGA would withdraw from the video game console market after the poor performance of the Dreamcast.</p><p name="e9cb" id="e9cb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sony would make its first, highly successful foray into the video game hardware market in the 5th generation, with its highly-popular PlayStation. Sony would then go on to release the PS2, PS3 and PS4 in subsequent generations.</p><p name="8596" id="8596" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Microsoft made its way onto the video game hardware stage in the 6th generation with the introduction of the Xbox, shaking up the Japanese-dominated market. Afterwards, it would go on to release the Xbox 360 and Xbox One in subsequent generations.</p><p name="8c56" id="8c56" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We will compare number of title releases and video game software unit sales over time for home consoles that were released in concurrent generations, as follows below:</p><p name="8041" id="8041" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">4th Generation: Nintendo SNES, SEGA Genesis</p><p name="5198" id="5198" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">5th Generation: Nintendo 64, SEGA Saturn, Sony PlayStation</p><p name="2124" id="2124" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">6th Generation: Microsoft Xbox, Nintendo GameCube, SEGA Dreamcast, Sony PlayStation 2</p><p name="2abc" id="2abc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">7th Generation: Microsoft Xbox 360, Nintendo Wii, Sony PlayStation 3</p><p name="48cb" id="48cb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">8th Generation: Microsoft Xbox ONE, Nintendo Wii U, Sony PlayStation 4</p><figure name="0096" id="0096" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*KewMve0wz9gHVVrlAgG5aQ.png" data-width="914" data-height="774" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*KewMve0wz9gHVVrlAgG5aQ.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Graphic created in Tableau</figcaption></figure><p name="1fed" id="1fed" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Nintendo’s SNES would dominate the 4th generation, easily surpassing the SEGA Genesis in terms of library size and video game software units sold.</p><figure name="6e3b" id="6e3b" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*IT8KD5ZND_ULGG9wi_3Y7Q.png" data-width="931" data-height="784" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*IT8KD5ZND_ULGG9wi_3Y7Q.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Graphic created in Tableau</figcaption></figure><p name="58be" id="58be" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Sony’s PlayStation enjoyed massive popularity and an expansive library in the 5th generation.</p><figure name="2d52" id="2d52" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*n3tI08x8IenOWyXFNHPwbg.png" data-width="920" data-height="777" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*n3tI08x8IenOWyXFNHPwbg.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Graphic created in Tableau</figcaption></figure><p name="97f8" id="97f8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Sony’s PlayStation 2 is the best-selling video game console of all time, and thus would enjoy a vast library of games and very high software sales.</p><figure name="19fc" id="19fc" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*82RaqK5KZjOjEk_uf2ni6w.png" data-width="919" data-height="783" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*82RaqK5KZjOjEk_uf2ni6w.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Graphic created in Tableau</figcaption></figure><p name="c529" id="c529" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The Wii was highly popular in the early years after its release.

Some examples of genres are:</p><p name="0b31" id="0b31" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Action: Gameplay revolves around overcoming challenges, and emphasizes hand-eye coordination and reaction time. Subgenres may include shooters, platformers and fighting games.</p><p name="dbfb" id="dbfb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Adventure: Gameplay places focus on narrative story-telling, puzzle-solving and exploration.</p><p name="84bc" id="84bc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Role-playing: Gameplay involves controlling a character in a well-established world. Emphasis is placed on decision-making, story-telling, and player character development.</p><p name="d2ca" id="d2ca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Simulation: Gameplay can be highly varied, but in general is meant to simulate real-world activities to a high degree of accuracy.</p><p name="6b00" id="6b00" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sports: A subgenre of simulation. Gameplay simulates the practice of physical sports such as football.</p><p name="a00e" id="a00e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Racing: Gameplay involves partaking in a racing competition, using any manner of land, sea, air or space vehicle.</p><p name="bf09" id="bf09" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Puzzle: Gameplay can be highly varied, but in general emphasizes puzzle-solving capabilities or logical reasoning.</p><p name="aa7c" id="aa7c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In order to answer the question of which regions prefer which genres, we will break down the total regional video game software unit sales by genre.</p><figure name="816b" id="816b" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*ZQwlq2JhmluE3pzIssdFAQ.png" data-width="1821" data-height="1168" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ZQwlq2JhmluE3pzIssdFAQ.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Graphic created in Tableau</figcaption></figure><p name="f9bc" id="f9bc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">North America, Europe, and the other regions follow the same pattern for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd most popular genres, being action, sports and shooters respectively.

Similar rating boards are based in Japan (CERO) and Europe (PEGI), which rate video games in their respective regions.</p><p name="c5e6" id="c5e6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The ratings that the ESRB uses include:</p><p name="18bf" id="18bf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Early Childhood (eC): Suitable for a preschool audience.</p><p name="d144" id="d144" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Everyone (E): Generally suitable for everyone. Prior to 1998, this rating was called Kids to Adults (K-A).</p><p name="9682" id="9682" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Everyone 10+ (E10+): Contains content that is unsuitable for children under 10 years old. Introduced in 2005.</p><p name="f9d9" id="f9d9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Teen (T): Contains content that is suitable only for teenagers aged 13 and above.</p><p name="0a5e" id="0a5e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Mature (M): Contains content that is suitable only for those aged 17 and above.</p><p name="51f6" id="51f6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Adults Only (AO): Contains content that is suitable only for those aged 18 and above. This rating is used for when the impact of the content exceeds that covered by the M rating.</p><p name="86b9" id="86b9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Rating Pending (RP): A placeholder rating used in promotional materials for a game prior to its release, before it has been assigned an official rating by the ESRB.</p><p name="2e91" id="2e91" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A game’s rating may affect its sales in a number of ways. A game rated E is accessible to more potential gamers, but a game rated M may attract more gamers due to being “cooler.”</p><p name="6c50" id="6c50" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In order to answer the question, we will look at total sales of games by rating, average sales of games by rating, and global sales over the years, broken down by rating.</p><figure name="eded" id="eded" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*ugwHKUorTRTborGm_Q8iEQ.png" data-width="1417" data-height="785" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ugwHKUorTRTborGm_Q8iEQ.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Graphic created in Tableau</figcaption></figure><p name="f168" id="f168" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">We can see that games rated E account for the highest number of total global sales, though this is a product of the fact that most games being released are rated E. Disregarding AO as that rating contains incredibly niche and sometimes frankly disturbing entries, and knowing that K-A is simply an earlier version of E, we see that games rated M tend to sell more on average than lower-rated titles.</p><figure name="a029" id="a029" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*Mns_ThNHW1Qb0Y_aIF0IrQ.png" data-width="1764" data-height="1175" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Mns_ThNHW1Qb0Y_aIF0IrQ.png"></figure><p name="ddf9" id="ddf9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Between 2000 and 2010, the proportion of “child-friendly” games (E10+ and below) was over half of all sales, which suggests that the accessibility of a game was more important to its sales in this time period. However, from 2008 onwards we see that the absolute number of games that are rated M remains relatively constant, compared to the shrinking number of lower-rated games being sold. This may be due to the more casual gamers who might be drawn to lower-rated games shifting over to mobile gaming, while the more “hardcore” gamers who would play higher-rated games stuck with dedicated gaming hardware.</p><h3 name="132a" id="132a" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Answering Question 4</h3><p name="527f" id="527f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Which games do critic opinions and user opinions differ on most?</p><figure name="993e" id="993e" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*7oaXOwqhCVY1rQ3V4G_elw.png" data-width="653" data-height="316" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*7oaXOwqhCVY1rQ3V4G_elw.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption"><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/switch/pokemon-sword" data-href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/switch/pokemon-sword" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Retrieved from: metacritic.com</a></figcaption></figure><p name="5fa5" id="5fa5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">As with all other forms of entertainment media, there is room for disagreement between professional critics and casual players on the quality of a game.</p><p name="0dc8" id="0dc8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The reasons for why the opinions of professional reviewers and the opinions of casual reviewers may differ are many, so we won’t go into too much detail on them.</p><p name="9f20" id="9f20" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We are interested however in which games this difference of opinion occurs the greatest in.

Otherwise, we will get results including games that are satirically declared by users to be “masterpieces.” We will calculate the difference between User Score values, and Critic Score values (Taking the average if a game appears on more than one platform), and find which games have the highest difference (loved by users, panned by critics), and which have the lowest (panned by users, loved by critics).</p><p name="3337" id="3337" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">First, the games that users rated higher than critics:</p><figure name="d8e9" id="d8e9" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*8EGs58hb0YUAJfT-W4Hryg.png" data-width="1408" data-height="1062" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*8EGs58hb0YUAJfT-W4Hryg.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Graphic created in Tableau</figcaption></figure><p name="2412" id="2412" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Next, the games that critics rated higher than users:</p><figure name="ce8f" id="ce8f" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*syc5w7ogGGIdHZl4uwCHfg.png" data-width="1419" data-height="1070" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*syc5w7ogGGIdHZl4uwCHfg.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Graphic created in Tableau</figcaption></figure><p name="7a32" id="7a32" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">And finally, a scatter plot of all games that are included after filtering, with the most critically underrated game (<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Predator: Concrete Jungle</em>) and critically overrated game (<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Company of Heroes 2</em>) annotated:</p><figure name="e4ce" id="e4ce" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*PO_BntRxOZ71ClOUtyOcGQ.png" data-width="1040" data-height="1067" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*PO_BntRxOZ71ClOUtyOcGQ.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Graphic created in Tableau</figcaption></figure><p name="2f4c" id="2f4c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Having a look at the Metacritic user reviews of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Predator: Concrete Jungle</em> on Xbox reveals that most positive user reviews come from fans of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Predator,</em> who feel the game pays excellent fan service to the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Predator</em> franchise. Critic opinions on <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Predator: Concrete Jungle</em> admit the game is faithful to the film but criticize its technical issues, including subpar graphics and loose controls.</p><p name="de6b" id="de6b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Looking at the Metacritic user reviews of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Company of Heroes 2</em> on PC shows overwhelming negative scores, accusing the developer Relic Entertainment of inappropriate historical revisionism and offensive portrayal of the Soviet Red Army.

EA notably sees very high sales when it comes to its shooters and sports games, and have entire studios dedicated to their development (DICE and EA Sports respectively). Nintendo is well-known for its best-selling platformer series <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Super Mario</em>, best-selling role-playing series <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Pokémon</em>, and best-selling action-adventure series <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Legend of Zelda</em>. Activision consistently sees high sales when it comes to its <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Call of Duty</em> franchise.</p><p name="22ba" id="22ba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For the sake of simplicity, we will consider the top publishers to be those who see the highest global sales of their games. By this metric, the top publishers, each with sales of over 200 million units worldwide, are given below:</p><figure name="21de" id="21de" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*lxdWEr7O7Vc42f96PXo3nA.png" data-width="1434" data-height="894" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*lxdWEr7O7Vc42f96PXo3nA.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Graphic created in Tableau</figcaption></figure><p name="fc64" id="fc64" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">From these top 12 publishers, we will break down the genres of their published games using a couple of genre vs. publisher heat maps. One heat map will be based on the percentage of games of each genre published by a publisher, and the other will be based on what percentage of a publisher’s global sales that genre makes up:</p><figure name="375c" id="375c" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*8jZtec-Cz-PcyoHHI9V_QA.png" data-width="1652" data-height="1164" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*8jZtec-Cz-PcyoHHI9V_QA.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Graphics created in Tableau</figcaption></figure><p name="8c8c" id="8c8c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">From the heatmaps above, some standouts include:</p><p name="b2ae" id="b2ae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sports games making up 41% of EA’s published titles, 37% of Take-Two’s published titles, and 34% of Konami’s published titles. Sports games also make up 43% of EA’s global sales, 35% of Konami’s and 19% of Take-Two’s. EA sees most of these sales from their <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">FIFA</em> and <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Madden NFL </em>series, Take-Two from their <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">NBA 2K</em> series, and Konami from their <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Pro Evolution Soccer</em> series.</p><p name="5318" id="5318" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The action column being generally darker than the other columns in both the number of games released and global sales heatmaps. Action makes up 41% of Capcom’s games and 43% of its sales, while it makes up 53% of Take-Two’s sales. Notable action genres published by Capcom include <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Resident Evil</em>, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Devil May Cry</em> and <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Monster Hunter</em>. Take-Two’s <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Grand Theft Auto</em> series alone accounts for 40% of Take-Two’s sales.</p><p name="cf11" id="cf11" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Activision and Microsoft make 42% and 40% of their sales from shooters respectively, due to the popularity of the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Call of Duty</em> and <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Halo</em> franchises.</p><h3 name="7a93" id="7a93" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Takeaways</h3><p name="9575" id="9575" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The action genre is the most popular genre in terms of sales and titles released. This is likely due to the relative ease that one can settle down, learn the ropes of the game and play. Compared to genres like role-playing and simulation games which sometimes demand a significant time investment, and fighting and strategy games which sometimes have a steep learning curve, action games and their subgenres lend themselves more to pick-up-and-go gameplay. For this reason, we see that the top video game publishers tend to publish more action games.</p><p name="9cf6" id="9cf6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Critic opinion and user opinion can differ on video games for many reasons. The greatest driving force that causes this dissonance between professional and casual reviewers is usually emotional. A game that causes significant controversy or outrage can lead to “review bombing,” where users flood the offending game in question with the worst possible reviews. Conversely, users with a positive emotional attachment to a specific franchise may enjoy a particular game within that franchise more, compared to a reviewer who judges it in a vacuum.</p><p name="2ac2" id="2ac2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Japan really loves their role-playing games.</p></div></div></section>
